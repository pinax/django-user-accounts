Pinax
-------

Pinax is an open-source platform built on the Django Web Framework. It is an ecosystem of reusable Django apps, themes, and starter project templates.
This collection can be found at http://pinaxproject.com.

This app was developed as part of the Pinax ecosystem but is just a Django app and can be used independently of other Pinax apps.

In case of any questions we recommend you join our Pinax Slack team (http://slack.pinaxproject.com) and ping us there instead of creating an issue on GitHub. Creating issues on GitHub is of course also valid but we are usually able to help you faster if you ping us in Slack.
